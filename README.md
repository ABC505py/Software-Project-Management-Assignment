# Software-Project-Management-Assignment

Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
ANS:
The amount of time it takes to complete a software project usually has monetary implications because the client often has to go back to their pocket to pay for additional labour costs or to find stop gap solutions before the actual project is completed. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by prioritising the most important tasks to deliver a minimum viable product. They also need to ensure that there is effective communication with the client to ensure that any issues are caught early on.

How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? 
ANS:
Effective cost contol can prevent the project from going over budget. It also helps to identify financial risk that may be caused by the project early on and allow the project team to mitigate them. Lastly it enables clients to do effective resource allocation and maximise on return on investment at the same time. All these are metrics of project success.

What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
ANS:
Thorough scoping - before embarking on a software project, a thorough scoping should be done to clearly define what the project will cover.This scope should be well documented and shared with the client to ensure that both parties are clear on the result they should expect.
Effective communication - the project manager should ensure that there is effective and regular communication with the client. This can be done by scheduling regular briefing sessions with both the project team and client. During this sessions updates on project progress as well as arising issues can be discussed. This helps to keep everyone at ease and mitigate risks arising from issues early on.
Accurate cost estimates - As part of the scoping document th project manager should include cost estimates. These estimates should be reasonable but include a buffer to cater for arising issues so that there is a balance between giving the client the lowest cost possible while making sure there are adequate financial resources for the implementation.

Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
ANS:
In the waterfall methodology there is a step by step approach to the project where one step is complete before moving on to the next while inagile there is a flexible approach where the implementation takes into account the changing needs of the client. Furthermore, there is not much client involvement in the waterfall methodology while the agile methodology puts a lot of emphasis on client involvement.
The advantages of the agile methodology are:
beacuse it allows aearly access to the software which helps for early program detection.
it emphasises stakeholder participation which fosters effective communication leading to delivery of a higher quality product
it focuses on value creation for the client by delivering a minimum viable product that takes care of their functional needs and makes changes based on the feedback from the users to enhance the product.
The advantages of the waterfall methodology are:
There is a very clear project structure as there are pre-defined stages of the project which the project team follows during implementation.
It is very easy to track milestones because of the pre-defined implementation stages so the client can easily tell when the project is off-track
The nature of this methodology makes it difficult to go out of scope because it emphasises use of clearly pre-defined stages to implement a project
The disadvantages of the agile methodology are:
it makes it difficult to predict the outcome of the project due to its flexible nature.
the success of a project depends on the chemistry of an the implementation team because if they are poor communicators who cannot collaborate to make decisions, the project is likely to fail
It is difficult to use with a large project team because communication becomes harder to coordinate and this may lead to duplication of work or disagreements.
The disadvantages of the waterfall methodology are:
Because it is not flexible in nature, it does not easily accommodate changes hence is is not suitable for evolving projects
Because there is not much client involvement, software testing is done at the last stages of the project which is dangerous because issues may be found out too late
There may be resistance from users because they may feel that their opinions were not taken into account during the implementation.
